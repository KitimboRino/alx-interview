# Unlock All Boxes

## Problem Statement
You have `n` number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from `0` to `n - 1` and each box may contain keys to the other boxes. Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

### Function Prototype
```python
def canUnlockAll(boxes):
    """
    Determines if all boxes can be unlocked given the initial set of keys.

    Parameters:
    boxes (list of lists): Each index i contains a list of keys for boxes.

    Returns:
    bool: True if all boxes can be opened, otherwise False.
    """
```

## Solution Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. Below is a step-by-step explanation and pseudo code.

### Pseudo Code
1. Initialize:
    - `n` as the number of boxes.
    - `opened` as a list to keep track of whether each box is opened, initially only the first box (`boxes[0]`) is opened.
    - `keys` as a list containing the key to the first box (0).

2. While there are keys to process:
    - Get a key from the list of keys.
    - For each key in the current box:
        - If the key opens a valid and unopened box, mark the box as opened and add the key to the list of keys to be processed.

3. After processing all keys, check if all boxes are opened.

### Python Implementation

Here is the complete implementation of the solution in Python. You can find the implementation in the file [0-lockboxes.py](./0-lockboxes.py).

### Example Usage
```python
boxes = [[1], [2], [3], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: True

boxes = [[1, 2], [3], [], [0]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: True

boxes = [[1, 3], [2], [1, 3], [0, 2]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: True

boxes = [[1], [2], [1, 3], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: True

boxes = [[1], [2], [], [0]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: False
```

## Key Points:
- **Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(n + m), where `n` is the number of boxes and `m` is the total number of keys. This is because we visit each box at most once and process each key at most once.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as boxes with no keys and redundant keys efficiently.
